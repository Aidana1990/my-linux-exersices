You are responsible for managing user accounts on a Linux server. You have received a request to add several users to a specific group called "developers."

Open Terminal

Create Users:

Alice (Username: alice)

Bob (Username: bob)

Carol (Username: carol)

Create the "developers" group using the groupadd command.

Add Users to the "developers" Group:

Use the usermod command with the -aG options to add each user to the "developers" group.

The syntax : usermod -aG <groupName> <userName>. Replace <groupName> with "developers" and <userName> with the username of each user.

Verify that the users have been added to the "developers" group using the getent command: getent group developers. (its'not in the lecture, but it's good to know)

Optionally, you can verify the group membership for each user individually using the groups or id command: groups alice or

id alice (for your information)

Verify Carol's group membership using the groups command. This command should display the groups to which Carol belongs.
