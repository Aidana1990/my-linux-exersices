Greetings, Cyber Adventurer! In this quest, you'll venture into the "secure_data" directory to safeguard valuable information. Your mission is to strategically adjust permissions for three vital files: "confidential.txt", "top_secret.doc", and "classified.pdf". Only by mastering the numeric method can you shield this data from unauthorized access!

Instructions:

Begin your cybersecurity quest by accessing the "secure_data" directory in /home/user directory through your cyber terminal.

Navigate to the "secure_data" directory and list its contents.

Utilize the numeric method to fortify permissions for each file:

For the file "confidential.txt":

Grant the owner read and write access (6), allow the group to read (4), and lock out all others (0).

For the file "top_secret.doc":

Provide read and write privileges to the owner and group (6), while barring access to outsiders (0).

For the file "classified.pdf":

Enable the owner to read and execute (5), offer read-only access to the group (4), and maintain strict restrictions against unauthorized users (0).

Use "sudo" to execute commands with root privileges.

Once you've established your security measures, confirm the integrity of your permission settings with a thorough scan.

Command: ls -l
