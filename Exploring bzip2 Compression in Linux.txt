Practice creating and comparing compressed tar archives using bzip2 compression in a Linux environment.

Switch to the superuser (root) using: sudo su

Check if bzip2 is installed by running : which bzip2

If bzip2 is not installed, install it using: sudo apt install bzip2

Once installed, create a tar archive of the /etc directory with bzip2 compression: tar -cvjf /root/etcbackup.tar.bz2 /etc

Observe it's filesize: ls -ltr /root/etcbackup.tar*

Check the disk usage of the compressed file to compare it's size and confirm that the bz2 file is more compressed than the gz file:

du -sk /root/etcbackup.tar.bz2

Satisfied with the backup, list the bzip2 compressed file using the ls command to confirm its presence and completeness.
