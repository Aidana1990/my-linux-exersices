In this task, you'll take on the role of a brave explorer armed with only Vim, your trusty text editor, and your imagination.

Step 1: Imagine yourself as a pioneer, ready to uncover the secrets of a legendary island. Your first mission? Create a digital map named "treasure_map.txt" in your adventurer's hideout, nestled within the user's home directory (/home/user).

Step 2: With your basecamp established, navigate to your hideout by exploring the directories until you reach /home/user. Confirm your arrival using the 'ls' command, and you're set to start your journey.

Step 3: As the sun sets, open "treasure_map.txt" with Vim and get ready to map out your adventure.

Step 4: With each keystroke, jot down clues and landmarks that will guide future adventurers to hidden treasures. Enter insert mode by pressing " i " and unleash your imagination as you create your treasure map.
