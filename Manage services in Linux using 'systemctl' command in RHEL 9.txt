In this hands-on exercise, we'll dive into managing services in a Linux environment, specifically using the systemctl command on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 system. We'll explore different service units to learn how to check their status, start or stop them, enable or disable automatic startup, and confirm any changes in their state.

Checking the SSH Service's Status:

We'll begin by examining the current status of the SSH (Secure Shell) service. By typing sudo systemctl status ssh.service, we can gather detailed insights into whether the service is loaded, enabled, active, and its current runtime status. Press 'q' to quit.

Halting the SSH Service:

Next, let's pause the SSH service's operations. Using the command sudo systemctl stop ssh, we'll effectively halt the running SSH server process. This action ensures the service stops functioning, preventing any further remote connections.

Confirming Inactivity:

After stopping the SSH service, we need to verify its inactive status. With systemctl status ssh.service, we'll confirm that the service is indeed not running and has transitioned to a "dead" state, ensuring it's effectively disabled.

Enabling Automatic Startup for SSH:

Now, let's configure the SSH service for automatic startup during system boot. Executing sudo systemctl enable ssh will ideally set up the service to initiate automatically upon system initialization. However, if this command doesn't work as expected, you can manually start the service by running sudo systemctl start ssh. This ensures seamless remote access to the system. Press 'q' to quit.

Verifying Enabled Status:

Lastly, we'll double-check to ensure the SSH service is set for automatic startup. By typing systemctl status ssh.service, we'll confirm that the service is "enabled" and ready to commence during system boot, streamlining system accessibility. Press 'q' to quit.

By walking through these steps, we'll gain a deeper understanding of how to manage services efficiently in a Linux environment, empowering us to navigate system configurations with confidence and ease. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and mastery together!
