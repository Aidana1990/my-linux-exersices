Let's break down the output of the top command line by line:

Header Line (top):

This line displays the current time, system uptime, number of logged-in users, and the system load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

Task Information Line (Tasks):

This line provides a summary of the total number of tasks/processes, broken down by their current state:

total: Total number of processes currently being managed by the system.

running: Number of processes currently running.

sleeping: Number of processes waiting for an event to complete.

stopped: Number of processes that have been stopped (usually by a signal).

zombie: Number of processes that have terminated, but their exit status has not yet been retrieved by their parent process.

CPU Usage Line (%Cpu(s)):

This line presents a summary of CPU usage statistics:

%us: Percentage of CPU time spent running user processes.

%sy: Percentage of CPU time spent running system (kernel) processes.

%ni: Percentage of CPU time spent running processes with a manually set nice value.

%id: Percentage of CPU time spent idle.

%wa: Percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.

%hi: Percentage of CPU time spent servicing hardware interrupts.

%si: Percentage of CPU time spent servicing software interrupts.

%st: Percentage of CPU time stolen from this virtual machine by the hypervisor.

Memory Usage Line (KiB Mem and KiB Swap):

This line provides memory usage statistics:

KiB Mem: Total physical memory (RAM) and its usage breakdown.

KiB Swap: Total swap space and its usage breakdown.

Process List Header (PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND):

This line serves as the header for the process list and defines each column's meaning:

PID: Process ID.

USER: Username of the process owner.

PR: Priority of the process.

NI: Nice value of the process.

VIRT: Virtual memory used by the process.

RES: Resident memory size of the process.

SHR: Shared memory size of the process.

S: Process status (S=sleeping, R=running, Z=zombie, etc.).

%CPU: Percentage of CPU usage by the process.

%MEM: Percentage of memory usage by the process.

TIME+: CPU time consumed by the process.

COMMAND: Command or name of the process.

Process List:

Below the header line, top lists the processes currently running on the system. Each line represents a single process, with information displayed in columns as defined by the header.

Notice how the information updates in real-time.

Understanding these lines will give you a comprehensive view of the system's current state and resource usage.
