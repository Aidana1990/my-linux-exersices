You are a system administrator responsible for backing up critical system configuration files on a Linux server. One of your tasks is to create a compressed archive of the "/etc" directory, which contains important configuration files for various system services.

Start by becoming the root user using the 'sudo su' command.

Use the tar command to create a tar archive named "etcbackup.tar" of the "/etc" directory: tar -cvf /root/etcbackup.tar /etc

Use the ls command to list the created tar archive, paying attention to the file size: ls -ltr /root/etcbackup.tar

Use the du command to check the disk usage of the tar archive: du -sk /root/etcbackup.tar

Once the tar archive is created, you proceed to compress it using gzip compression method to save disk space : gzip /root/etcbackup.tar

Use the ls command to list the compressed gzip file and compare its size: ls -ltr /root/etcbackup.tar.gz

Check the disk usage of the compressed file in kilobytes using the du command to quantify the reduction in size achieved by compression: du -sk /root/etcbackup.tar.gz

Analyze the results and confirm that the size of the compressed archive is significantly smaller compared to the uncompressed tar file, demonstrating the effectiveness of compression in optimizing storage space.

List the compressed file use 'ls' command.
